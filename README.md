# Magnus - Your Personal Assistant

## Description

Magnus is a sophisticated personal assistant application designed to help me by making my life easy by helping out in daily activities or assisting me in my assignments. Magnus leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural language understanding and response generation, Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audio responses, and the SpeechRecognition library for processing spoken questions.

## Features

- **Text-based Interaction**: Users can ask questions via a text input field, and Magnus will provide responses generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5.
- **Voice Recognition**: Users can ask questions using their voice, thanks to the integration of the SpeechRecognition library and Google’s speech-to-text service.
- **Audio Responses**: Magnus responds with text as well as audio, utilizing the gTTS library to convert text responses into speech.
- **Dynamic and Responsive UI**: The web interface is built with HTML and CSS, which gives it a clean and responsive design that enhances user experience.
- **Real-time Audio Playback**: Implemented audio playback ensures that responses are not only read but also heard, making the interaction more engaging.
